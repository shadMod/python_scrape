# Python scrape

A simple feature to scrape website.

Web scraping has existed for a long time and, in its good form.

“Good bots” enable, for example, search engines to index web content, price comparison services to save consumers money, and market researchers to gauge sentiment on social media.

However “Bad bots” fetch content from a website with the intent of using it for purposes outside the site owner’s control.
Bad bots make up 20 percent of all web traffic and are used to conduct a variety of harmful activities, such as denial of service attacks, competitive data mining, online fraud, account hijacking, data theft, stealing of intellectual property, unauthorized vulnerability scans, spam and digital ad fraud.

This app is a simple feature that is not intended to harm any site and is for purely private (non-commercial) use.
The undersigned is not liable for any direct or indirect use as mentioned in the MIT license in use in this repo.
